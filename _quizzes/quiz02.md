## Quiz 2 Instructions

+ The purpose of this quiz is to support your learning by
    - offering you an opportunity to demonstrate your mastery of course material
    - providing feedback so that you can plan your studying
    - letting you see how your instructor writes quiz/exam questions, and grades them
    - ... in a low-stakes quiz, with plenty of time for you to make any needed adjustments before the first exam

+ This is a take home quiz:
    - The quiz will become available at **6:00am** on **Sunday, September 6**.
    - The quiz must be completed by **6:00pm** on **Wednesday, September 9**.

+ The quiz is completed using a combination of [WeBWorK](https://zeno.boisestate.edu/webwork2) and [BlackBoard](https://blackboard.boisestate.edu).
    - The quiz questions are given in WeBWorK. Submit your answers in WeBWorK.
      You can use unlimited submissions, but you will not receive feedback on the correctness of the answers when submitted.
      (The purpose of multiple submissions is in case you find a mistake, or type your answer wrong.)
    - In addition to answering the questions in WeBWorK, upload the written solutions to BlackBoard.

+ Quality of presentation of written work is a significant part of the grade. This includes:
    - **Neatness:** Sloppy work will score poorly, if it gets graded at all.
    - **Organization:** Work must be easy to find and easy to follow.
    - **Communication:** Work must show how you reached your answer, and must make correct use of mathematical notation.
    - Complete each question on a new page(s).

+ Solutions can be written by hand or using computer software, then create a .pdf document to upload.
    - **Handwritten:** Write the solutions in easy to read hand writing,
      then scan the result using a tool like GeniusScan to create a single .pdf document.
    - **Annotation Software:** Use annotation software to write up the solutions in easy to read writing.
      Then save the result as a flattened .pdf document.
    - **Typesetting Software:** Use computer software such as LaTeX or Word+MathType to type up the solutions,
      then save the result as a .pdf document.
    - Solutions should be a single .pdf file with a filename of the form `333-quiz02-yourlastname.pdf`,
      for example `333-quiz02-Teitler.pdf`.

+ When working on the quiz **students may:**
    - Discuss the questions with other students and/or the learning assistant.
    - Ask their instructor for help.
    - Use any of the course resources, notes, videos, etc. on the course website, or similar style resources.
    - Use calculators or computers to do basic arithmetic.

+ When working on the quiz **students may not:**
    - Ask any person to complete any part of the quiz for them.
    - Copy another person's work and present it as their own.
    - Explicitly look up the solution to any problem online.
    - Aid another student in any of the above activities.
    - Commit any other infraction of the [Student Code of Conduct](https://www.boisestate.edu/policy/student-affairs/code-of-conduct/).
